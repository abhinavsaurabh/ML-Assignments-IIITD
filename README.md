# Machine Learning Assignments - IIIT Delhi

This repository contains a collection of machine learning assignments completed during the Monsoon 2020 semester at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-Delhi). These assignments were part of the coursework for the Machine Learning course (CSE343) and cover various fundamental and advanced topics in machine learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each corresponding to a specific assignment:

- **Assignment 1**: Introduction to Machine Learning and Python
- **Assignment 2**: Supervised Learning - Regression
- **Assignment 3**: Supervised Learning - Classification
- **Assignment 4**: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
- **Assignment 5**: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
- **Assignment 6**: Model Evaluation and Validation

Each directory contains the following files:

- **Assignment Report**: A detailed PDF report explaining the problem statement, approach, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **Code Files**: Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`) implementing the solutions.
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used for training and testing the models, if applicable.

## Assignment Details

### Assignment 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Python

This assignment involved setting up the Python environment and familiarizing with essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Tasks included data manipulation, visualization, and implementing simple linear regression from scratch.

### Assignment 2: Supervised Learning - Regression

Focused on implementing various regression algorithms, including multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and ridge regression. The objective was to predict continuous outcomes and evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

### Assignment 3: Supervised Learning - Classification

In this assignment, classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines were implemented. The goal was to classify data into discrete categories and assess performance using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Assignment 4: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering

Explored clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group similar data points without predefined labels. Evaluated the quality of clusters using metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

### Assignment 5: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimensionality of datasets. Analyzed the impact on model performance and visualized data in lower-dimensional spaces.

### Assignment 6: Model Evaluation and Validation

Focused on techniques for evaluating and validating machine learning models, including cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and handling overfitting/underfitting. Implemented Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter optimization.

## Code Structure and Understanding

The code for each assignment is structured to ensure clarity and modularity:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading datasets, handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Implementation**: Building machine learning models using both custom implementations and leveraging libraries like Scikit-Learn.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training models on the training set, making predictions, and evaluating performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotting graphs and charts to illustrate data distributions, model performance, and results.

Each Jupyter Notebook or Python script is well-documented with comments and markdown cells to explain the code and the underlying concepts.
